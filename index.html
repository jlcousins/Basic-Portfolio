      <p> My name is Janavia Cousins, welcome to my webpage! I am from Raleigh, North Carolina. I have resided in
        Charlotte, NC for 6 years. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management from The University of North
        Carolina at Charlotte. I am currently a Client Relationship Specialist at NewDominion Bank. </p>
      <p> I loveeee dogs! I have never been without a pet dog since the day I was born. My favorite colors are yellow
        and pink. I love to cook and discover new recipes. Puzzles, crossword puzzles, and reading are also some of my
        hobbies.</p>
      <p> My favorite quote is "Control the Controllables" I live by that every single day. If I cannot control the
        outcome, I do not let it control my feelings. BUT If I can control the outcome, I will do everything in my
        power to do what is right for me! </p>
