  <p> My name is Janavia Cousins, welcome to my webpage!  I am from Raleigh, North Carolina. I have resided in Charlotte, NC for 6 years.  I received my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  I am currently a Client Relationship Specialist at NewDominion Bank. </p>
  <br>
  <p> I loveeee dogs!  I have never been without a pet dog since the day I was born.  My favorite colors are yellow and pink.  I love to cook and discover new recipes.  Puzzles, crossword puzzles, and reading are also some of my hobbies.</p>
  <br>
  <p> My favorite quote is "Control the Controllables"  I live by that every single day.  If I cannot control the outcome,  I do not let it control my feelings.  BUT If I can control the outcome, I will do everything in my power to do what is right for me! </p>
